User Stories
As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.
